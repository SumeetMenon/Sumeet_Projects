# Password Cracking using Cuda

This project was basically a class assignment for (Principles of Computer Security) in which I had to crack a password which was in the form of a Word+punctuation+Word+punctuation+Word. The motive of this assignment was basically to use an offline dictionary attack which to crack our passwords. 
Cuda programming played a very important role in this kind of an assignment as it uses its multiple processors to enhance the speed at which the password can be cracked.
